## Tech Stach Used
•	OpenAI: OpenAI’s models, can be used in Python through the OpenAI API key. To interact with OpenAI’s language sign up from an API key from the OpenAI website than install the OpenAI python library.
•	Speech Recognition: ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system such as Google’s Speech-to-text or Mozilla Deep Speech for voice recognition.
•	Voice Synthesis: Text-to-speech (TTS) engines like Google Text-to-speech.
## Organization
•	Organization: Stuvalley Technology                                                                                                                                                              •	Mentors: Mr. Ayushman Pranav, Dr. Pankaj Mishra
## Observation
•	A well-designed Jarvis AI system can significantly enhance efficiency by automating routine tasks, managing schedules, and responding to queries. Users may observe time savings and reduced manual efforts                                                                                                                                                                                   •	The accuracy of voice recognition can impact user satisfaction. An observation might include improvements in voice recognition over time, leading to more accurate responses.                  •	As the user base grows, the AI system should maintain its responsiveness and scalability, ensuring a consistent experience for users.                                                          
•	The AI's knowledge base can impact the quality of responses. Users may notice improvements in the system's ability to provide accurate information and answer questions correctly.
